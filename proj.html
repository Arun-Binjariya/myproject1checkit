        <h1>Locust Surveillance Using Geospatial Technology</h1>
        <h2>1. Scheduled Desert Area of India</h2>
        <p>
          The Scheduled Desert Area (SDA) in India refers to specific regions
          within Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana, designated for desert locust
          monitoring and control. These areas are prone to desert locust
          breeding and outbreaks, particularly during the monsoon season when
          favorable breeding conditions exist. The SDA covers a total area of
          approximately 2.05 lakh sq km. <br />
          <span>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</span> <br />
          <span>Location:</span> The SDA primarily encompasses parts of
          Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana. <br />
          <span>Rajasthan:</span> The largest portion of the SDA lies within
          Rajasthan, covering about 1.79 lakh sq km. <br />
          <span>Gujarat:</span> Gujarat accounts for roughly 23,077 sq km of the
          SDA. <br />
          <span>Haryana:</span> Haryana contributes about 3,457 sq km to the
          SDA. <br />
          <span>Purpose:</span> The SDA is designated to facilitate the work of
          the Locust Warning Organization (LWO) in monitoring and controlling
          desert locust populations. <br />
          <span>Locust Activity:</span> The SDA provides suitable breeding
          grounds for desert locusts, particularly during the monsoon season
          (May to November). <br />
          <span>Monitoring and Control:</span> The LWO conducts regular surveys
          and control operations within the SDA to mitigate the risk of locust
          plagues. <br />
          <span>Economic Threshold:</span> Surveys aim to identify areas where
          locust populations have reached the economic threshold level,
          indicating a need for control measures.

        <h2>2. Various Stages of life cycle (Schistocerca gregaria)</h2>
        <p>
          The Desert Locust, Schistocerca gregaria, undergoes a three-stage life
          cycle: egg, hopper (nymph), and adult. The female locust lays eggs in
          the soil, which hatch into hoppers that undergo several molts before
          becoming winged adults. The entire cycle, from egg to adult, can take
          from a few weeks to a few months, influenced by environmental
          conditions.

          3. Locust Breeding Points in Thar Desert Region during July 2020
        </h2>
        <p>
          In July 2020, the Thar Desert region experienced significant locust
          activity, with breeding and swarms reported in several districts of
          Rajasthan and Gujarat. Key areas included Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur,
          Bikaner, Churu, Nagaur, Sri Ganganagar, Jhunjhunu, Hanumangarh, and
          Kutch district of Gujarat. Heavy rainfall during this period created
          favorable conditions for locust breeding along the India-Pakistan
          border. <br />
          <span>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</span> <br />
          <span>Rajasthan:</span>
          Locusts were active in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu,
          Nagaur, Sri Ganganagar, Jhunjhunu, Hanumangarh, and Sikar. <br />
          <span>Gujarat:</span>
          Locusts were also present in the Kutch district. <br />
          <span>Breeding Conditions:</span>
          Heavy rains, particularly along the border, contributed to increased
          breeding activity. <br />
          <span>Control Operations:</span>
          Locust control operations were carried out in several districts,
          targeting both swarms and hoppers. <br />
          <span>Crop Damage:</span>
          Locusts caused significant crop damage in various districts, including
          Sri Ganganagar, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Churu, and
          Nagaur.

        <h2>4. Probable Direction of Locust Migration</h2>
        <p>
          Locusts primarily migrate with the wind, meaning they generally fly
          downwind. While they can also fly upwind, their migrations are largely
          influenced by wind direction. They don't have a specific directional
          sense, but rather react to various environmental cues, including wind,
          the sun, and other visual stimuli. <br />
          <span>Factors Influencing Locust Migration:</span><br /><span
            >Wind:</span
          ><br />Locusts are known to fly with the wind, making downwind
          movement the dominant pattern. However, they can also fly upwind,
          especially when responding to other stimuli or trying to maintain a
          specific swarm direction.<br /><span>Sun and other visual cues:</span
          ><br />Locusts use the sun and other visual features of their
          environment to orient themselves during migration.<br /><span
            >Environmental factors:</span
          ><br />Temperature, humidity, and the availability of food also play a
          role in determining where locusts migrate.
