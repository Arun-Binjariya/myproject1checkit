        <h1>About RRSC - West, NRSC, ISRO</h1>
        <p>
          RRSC-West, Jodhpur is working closely with different stakeholders of
          natural resources management in the region since last three decades.
          Besides national priorities, it is also taking care of the
          requirements of geospatial technologies in the region and the
          priorities of the state governments. Based on the priority areas, the
          centre has identified the dominant and secondary regional issues, and
          pursuing different application projects addressing them in a focused
          manner. Over the years, the centre has developed expertise accordingly
          in the region on specific aspects of geospatial technology and
          applications with a special emphasis on arid ecosystems. Regional
          issues that needs geospatial attention are being addressed in
          collaboration with stakeholders, R&D organizations of state/centre and
          also leading academia in the region. The centre has become a regional
          knowledge centre and data hub for geospatial applications in the
          western region of India. In addition, outreach activities towards
          popularizing the geospatial education especially in Rajasthan state is
          also another important activity.

      <h1>Locusts</h1>
      <p>
        A Threat to Agriculture and the Role of Space-Based Disaster Management
        (SDA)
      </p>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <div class="cardbox">
        <div class="card"><img src="pi2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
        <div class="par">
          <p>
            Locusts are short-horned grasshoppers that, under suitable environmental conditions, undergo a transformation into a gregarious form capable of forming destructive swarms. These swarms can cover hundreds of square kilometers, consuming massive quantities of vegetation, including food crops, pasture, and even tree bark. Locust infestations are considered a serious transboundary pest problem, with the potential to cause major agricultural losses, disrupt food security, and endanger rural economies. <br>
Nature and Behavior of Locusts <br>
The most notorious of the species is the Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria), found in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. A single square kilometer swarm can contain up to 80 million locusts, capable of eating the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people. These locusts breed rapidly in moist desert soils, especially after unseasonal or heavy rainfall, and can travel up to 150 km per day aided by favorable winds.
Locust outbreaks typically occur in three phases: outbreak, upsurge, and plague. The transition from a solitary phase to a gregarious phase, triggered by environmental and ecological changes, makes them highly unpredictable without technological intervention.

      <h2>2. Impact on Agriculture and Livelihoods</h2>
      <div class="cardbox">
        <div class="card"><img src="pi3.png" alt="" /></div>
        <div class="par">
          <p>
            Locust invasions can cause devastating crop losses, affecting the livelihoods of millions of farmers and pastoralists. The 2020-21 locust outbreak across East Africa, the Middle East, and India was one of the worst in decades, driven by unusual weather patterns and cyclones linked to climate change. It destroyed thousands of hectares of crops, forcing many into food insecurity. <br>
In India, states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh faced severe invasions, where standing crops were decimated, affecting both kharif and rabi production cycles. These attacks directly impacted national food supply chains, export earnings, and farmer incomes, highlighting the need for robust early-warning and response systems

      <h2>3. Role of Space-Based Disaster Management (SDA)</h2>
      <div class="cardbox1">
        <p>
          Space technology plays a pivotal role in managing locust outbreaks by providing real-time monitoring, early warning, and decision-support systems. Satellite-based observations support the following key components:
        </p>
        <div class="cd1">
          <h3>1. Monitoring Breeding Conditions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from satellites like MODIS, Sentinel-2, and Landsat help track vegetation growth - a key indicator of potential breeding areas.</li>
            <li>Soil moisture and temperature data aid in assessing habitat suitability for locust egg-laying and development.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cd1">
          <h3>2. Rainfall and Climate Analysis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Satellites like TRMM and GPM offer near-real-time rainfall data, crucial in predicting locust population booms.</li>
            <li>Climate forecasting tools help anticipate unusual weather patterns that can trigger locust outbreaks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cd1">
          <h3>3. Locust Movement Prediction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Combining satellite-derived weather models with wind and temperature forecasts enables prediction of swarm trajectories.</li>
            <li>Platforms like FAO's Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS) use these models to coordinate international response efforts.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cd1">
          <h3>4. Operational Response Planning</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>National platforms like ISRO's Bhuvan portal integrate satellite imagery with locust sightings to plan pesticide spraying and field surveillance.</li>
